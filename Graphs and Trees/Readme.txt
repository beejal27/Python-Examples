This folder contains following programs.

List of topics already discussed:
1. BSF_Path.py (Breadth First Search) - Algorithm (Breadth First Search - BFS) to search if path exists between two given nodes.
2. BSTMinimalCreate.py - Algorithm to create a Binary Search Tree (BST)
3. BstToLinkedList.py - Algo to create list of LinkedList from given BST. Each LinkedList contains node at same level.
4. LinkedList.py - Data Structure to create a LinkedList object.
5. Tree Traversal - Discussed In-Order (Left, Node, Right), Pre-Order (Node, Left, Right) & Post-Order (Left, Right, Node)
6. CheckBalancedBinaryTree.py - Algorithm to check if given Binary Tree is Balanced.
7. CheckBST.py - Algorithm to check if given Binary Tree is Binary Search Tree.
8. BSTNextNode.py - Algorithm to get the next node for a given node in Binary Search Tree.

List of topics to be discussed:
10. OrderProjecs2.py - Algorithm to Order Projects according to their dependencies (Using Depth First Search approach).
11. CommonAncestor1.py - Algorithm to find a Common ancestor between two nodes in a Binary Tree. Nodes have link to parent nodes.
